# ToDo-List-Project
Contains files for the project I completed in my Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Class

For my final project I will create a simple console to-do list. When the program runs, a menu prints to the console and users input an integer corresponding to the menu option they want. The first option, ‘Add a task’, lets users add a task to the list. They can specify the task’s name, description and the date when it is due. After the task is added, a print statement tells the user that their addition was successful, asks if they have more to do, and prints the menu again. The other menu options include: printing the highest priority task, printing the entire task list, marking a task as completed, and lastly an option to exit the program.   


I will use the abstract data type PriorityQueue. I will use this data type because it will let me process the task objects based on priority, which is of great concern to those usings to do lists. I plan on using Java in eclipse to program this project.
